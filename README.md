Hello everyone! This is one of the projects I've had most fun writing. Here is how it works:

1) I coded a simple calculator app in Python.
2) I created an AWS IAM user with the necessary permissions to trigger a Lambda function and access an S3 bucket, using Terraform.
3) I wrote the Lamba function (using Terraform)
4) I created an S3 bucket using Terraform.

The Lamba, upon trigger, displays the simple calculator app on the user's browser.
